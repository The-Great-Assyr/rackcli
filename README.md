# rackcli
Platform commandline-interface (CLI) for [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/) for managing your local rack installation, installed plugins, and patches. Additionally, this provides a complementary incubation venue for prototyping/implementing features/capabilities experimentally in consideration in the official VCV Rack environment under an alternative development model.

rackcli CLI features cater towards making your life easier for both your rack install and the plugins/modules you've installed. Features are composable with JSON output. Cross-platform, single binary without external dependencies or compiler/interpreter installations required.
