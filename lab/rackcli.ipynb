    "\n",
    "This is a collection of research discussions/prototypes for icubating ideas and features for [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/) under the umbrella of [rackcli](https://github.com/dirkleas/rackcli). These presentations assume metadata extracted via my [VCV Rack fork](https://github.com/dirkleas/Rack) or using my plugin [DLwigglz r4kH4x](https://github.com/dirkleas/DLwigglz) along with an upcoming webservice [r4xH4x.cloud]() accessed through `rackcli`.  There's also series of companion \n",

    "\n",
    "Over time, this collection will grow to support a number of areas, ranging from simple ideas like patch module slicing through more sophisticated ideas like plugin/module analytics and patch construction using machine learning. Research such as this is plausible give that VCV Rack patches are stored as JSON text files -- the only \"extras\" are adding some extra metadata for things like module widths and a reference catalog of all your installed plugin modules (of course that includes width values too).\n",
    "\n",
    "That last little requirement for the extra metadata (e.g. width) is most easily accomplished usig a [fork I made](https://github.com/dirkleas/Rack) of the official VCV Rack project as it introduced a few minor changes to augment the existing patch save functionality width support, and a new function accessible via the `File.Catalog` menu to create a JSON catalog for all your installed plugins and their modules. This file is stored in your forked VCV Rack build folder. Another option not requiring using a fork is to use my plugin [DLwigglz r4xH4x](https://github.com/dirkleas/DLwigglz) module and `rackcli` to fill in the metadata holes. Here's an example fragment from the `catalog.json` recently generated from my installed plugins sourced from the Plugin Manager, and and other online sources (this is a very small fragment as I've typically got about 100 plugins installed) -- notice the `\"width\": 195` for the *AnimatedCircuits_Noises ACNoises* below:\n",

    "Building or installing a VCV Rack fork is hard and will mess up my workflow, right?! No, not really. Quite of few rackheads have built a local fork of VCV Rack so they can compile plugin modules from source code when they're either not through the official Plugin Manager workflow, or they're distributed directly by the developers (typically via [Github](https://github.com/topics/vcvrack).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two options for you to live happily with my VCV Rack fork: 1) use VCV Rack fork on an as-needed basis, or 2) use the fork most of the time and VCV Rack when you wish to check the Package Manager for updates or new plugins. Here's how each of those workflows might work for you.\n",

    "1. run VCV Rack and optionally update your plugins via `Update plugins` button and automatically exit\n",
    "1. if you update your plugins, add the module `r4xH4x` from the plugin `DLwigglz` and click the `Catalog (partial)` button\n",
    "1. run `rackcli --cloud catalog.partial.json` to load missing metadata -- you'll get feedback in the VCV Rack log `log.txt` identifying any plugins that haven't been cataloged by the community yet, **CURRENTLY WORK-IN-PROCESS!**\n",
    "1. run VCV Rack as usual and enjoy your fresh `catalog.json`\n",

    "See, either option adds minimal overhead to your patching workflow, but allows you to take advantage of the extra metadata for exciting reasons you'll soon appreciate.

    "*Now for the pseudo-warning: YMMV! I've found both my fork and plugin services are reasonably stable with plugins from the offical VCV Rack Plugin Manager, but sometimes I have issues with certain modules cleaning up after themselves (on my Mac, that's some of the fancier modules doing cool stuff dealing with MIDI for example). This even more common with bleeding-edge modules that I compile myself. As I identify such plugin modules, I'll just drag their plugin out of my `plugins` folder, and only install it when I need it. I find that when I start automating things/hacking my catalog of plugin modules, I see more because I use more. You get the picture. Just be aware, and enjoy your newfound superpowers!*\n",
