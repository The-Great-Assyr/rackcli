# rackcli lab

The "lab" is the place where ideas incubate using [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
notebooks (download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) ftw!),
**the** best [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
platform around -- also a goto for all things data science and machine learning.
Ideas expressed here may or may not end up being implemented in main rackcli toolchain.

Here's the basic starter set of "experiments":

1. rackcli - metadata what (`catalog.json`)? dox, the universal patch to document your catalog
1. rackcli_cloud - mechanics of how to augment your `catalog.partial.json`,
implemented in [rackcloud](https://github.com/dirkleas/rackcloud)
1. rackcli_slice - slicing patch "chunks" for import/export, layout management, etc.
1. rackcli_compose - compose patch fragments (e.g. cf mixer)
1. rackcli_sequence - the "10-second rule" and reasonable sequencing with virtually any sequencer (trigger and cv)
1. rackcli_h4x - indexing, module-based cataloging, and QA/benchmarking
1. rackcli_core - reusable bits
1. rackcli_screenshot - screenshot individual modules
1. rackcli_analytics - scrape rack patches from the wild

Use concept and/or code from the lab at your own risk!
